Reminder that I wasn't able to put on Signal R

The Local host can still be ran and they will connect to it

When You type a message first type

"Add Node:" send that
Next type what will the Node be "Example"

Now both should have it

"Remove Node:" works the same as Add Node

"Show Node:" returns all Nodes the player has
